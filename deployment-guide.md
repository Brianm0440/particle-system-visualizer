## Quick Start: Google Sites Method

**For immediate deployment, I recommend Option 1 (Google Sites):**

1. Open [sites.google.com](https://sites.google.com)
2. Create a new site
3. Add an "Embed" element
4. Copy the entire content of your `index.html` file
5. Paste it into the embed code section
6. Publish your site

This will give you a live URL like: `https://sites.google.com/view/your-site-name`

## File Structure for Deployment

Your current files are perfect for deployment:
```
📁 Your Project/
├── 📄 index.html          # Main HTML file
├── 📄 script.js           # JavaScript functionality
├── 📄 styles.css          # CSS styling
└── 📄 README.md           # Documentation
```

All files are self-contained and ready for deployment!

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure all files are uploaded
3. Verify file permissions are set correctly
4. Test the application locally first

**Recommended next step:** Try Option 1 (Google Sites) first - it's the easiest and most integrated with your Google Workspace!
